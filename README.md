# SlimeMold.jl
An attempt to use Agents.jl to roughly model slime mold. Inspired by this [incredible video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&t=895s) by Sebastian Lague of slime molds simulated on a GPU. I don't expect to be able to match the GPU visualizations, but perhaps we can do smaller sims with Agents.jl. This [write-up](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum) also has some excellent slime mold sim content, as well as descriptive pseudo-code and graphical explanations of how the process works.

## Plans
- [X] Agents move about mostly randomly
- [X] Agents lay down pheromones
- [ ] Agents can sense pheromones
- [ ] Agents follow pheromones
- [ ] Make pretty videos
